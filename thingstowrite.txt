We added a not-subjective word for each subjective word in wiebe's data in order to handle negation. are there other forms of negation?

We added some emoticons to Weibe's subjective data. 

We noticed several problems. At one point we realized we were overpenalizing tweets for Tangled because Tangled was a negative sentiment word.

We attempted at first to make use of the search api; however, Twitter is not conducive to searching the past, but it is an excellent source for polling the present. 

We initially attempted several simultaneous streaming requests; however, this quickly triggered Twitter's aggresive user defense. Instead we colapsed all of the queries down to one large query to be sorted by topic later

Our twitter data comes from all of Twitter, so it is not sorted by language or country. This might affect correlation with the movie data, as the box-office numbers are from domestic grosses.
